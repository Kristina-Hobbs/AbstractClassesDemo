  * Now create 2 non-abstract classes: Car and Motorcycle, that inherit from Vehicle
  * Add a distict property in the 2 derived classes such as HasTrunk for Car and HasSideCart for Motorcycle
  * Provide the implementations for the abstract methods
  * Only in the Motorcycle class will you override the virtual drive method
